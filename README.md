# Morse MSP432

String to morse code program written for the MSP432 using the SysTick timer's register values from the datasheet itself!

Written in VS Code, debugged using Code Composer Studio IDE so need to install that (or use the include files [here](https://github.com/ra3xdh/msp432_template)) if you wish to compile this project.
